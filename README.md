# Sakha 🧠📚

A minimal, line-art-based web experience that presents the problem and solution behind Sakha — a neighborhood-based learning initiative — inspired by the aesthetic of Lemonade’s 2019 Giveback page.

## 🎯 Objective

To communicate the challenge students face in commuting to distant learning centers and how Sakha solves it, through expressive, monochrome line illustrations and a clean, responsive layout.
